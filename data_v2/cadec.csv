do statins have a role in primary prevention?
no!
http://www.ti.ubc.ca/pages/letter48.htm#comment
a question to us about letter #48: what is the evidence of benefit for primary prevention in women?
there were 10,990 women in the primary prevention trials (28% of the total).

i eat ~normally~ folks!
i eat a balanced diet - no sugar, butter or cream, rarely coffee, but gallons of english tea with skimmed milk - i do eat margarine, red meat (cut the fat off) 2-3 times per week, and some cheese.
i drink maybe an average of 21 units of alcohol weekly (ale, red wine).
i rarely exercise, am 5ft 11inches and weigh 12 stone 10lbs (or 178 lbs).
i suggest getting your liver function test done with your cholesterol test every 6 months.
dr's are not gods and they don't know everything - some don't know much at all - talk to the experts - cardiologists and heart consultants!!!
take everything with a pinch of salt; be healthily sceptical; go slowly and be wary, but don't cut your life short by raging against a drug that may be saving/e.","['(', 'i', ""'"", 'm', '57', ')', '.', '\n', 'i', 'eat', '~', 'normally', '~', 'folks', '!', '\n', 'i', 'eat', 'a', 'balanced', 'diet', '-', 'no', 'sugar', ',', 'butter', 'or', 'cream', ',', 'rarely', 'coffee', ',', 'but', 'gallons', 'of', 'english', 'tea', 'with', 'skimmed', 'milk', '-', 'i', 'do', 'eat', 'margarine', ',', 'red', 'meat', '(', 'cut', 'the', 'fat', 'off', ')', '2', '-', '3', 'times', 'per', 'week', ',', 'and', 'some', 'cheese', '.', '\n', 'i', 'drink', 'maybe', 'an', 'average', 'of', '21', 'units', 'of', 'alcohol', 'weekly', '(', 'ale', ',', 'red', 'wine', ')', '.', '\n', 'i', 'rarely', 'exercise', ',', 'am', '5ft', '11inches', 'and', 'weigh', '12', 'stone', '10lbs', '(', 'or', '178', 'lbs', ')', '.', '\n', 'i', 'suggest', 'getting', 'your', 'liver', 'function', 'test', 'done', 'with', 'your', 'cholesterol', 'test', 'every', '6', 'months', '.', '\n', 'dr', ""'"", 's', 'are', 'not', 'gods', 'and', 'they', 'don', ""'"", 't', 'know', 'everything', '-', 'some', 'don', ""'"", 't', 'know', 'much', 'at', 'all', '-', 'talk', 'to', 'the', 'experts', '-', 'cardiologists', 'and', 'heart', 'consultants', '!', '!', '!', '\n', 'take', 'everything', 'with', 'a', 'pinch', 'of', 'salt', ';', 'be', 'healthily', 'sceptical', ';', 'go', 'slowly', 'and', 'be', 'wary', ',', 'but', 'don', ""'"", 't', 'cut', 'your', 'life', 'short', 'by', 'raging', 'against', 'a', 'drug', 'that', 'may', 'be', 'saving', '/', 'e', '.', '\n']","(179, 180, 181, 182, 184, 186, 187, 188, 189, 191, 195, 196, 204, 206, 211, 212, 213, 215, 219, 221, 230, 235, 237, 240, 245, 247, 254, 257, 262, 264, 271, 277, 279, 283, 291, 294, 302, 306, 311, 319, 324, 326, 328, 331, 335, 344, 346, 350, 355, 356, 360, 364, 368, 371, 373, 374, 375, 377, 383, 387, 391, 393, 397, 402, 408, 409, 410, 412, 418, 424, 427, 435, 438, 441, 447, 450, 458, 465, 466, 469, 471, 475, 479, 480, 481, 482, 484, 491, 499, 501, 504, 508, 517, 521, 527, 530, 536, 542, 543, 546, 550, 553, 554, 555, 556, 558, 566, 574, 579, 585, 594, 599, 604, 609, 614, 626, 631, 637, 639, 645, 646, 647, 649, 650, 652, 656, 660, 665, 669, 674, 677, 678, 680, 685, 696, 698, 703, 706, 707, 709, 714, 719, 722, 726, 728, 733, 736, 740, 748, 750, 764, 768, 774, 785, 786, 787, 788, 789, 794, 805, 810, 812, 818, 821, 825, 827, 830, 840, 849, 851, 854, 861, 865, 868, 872, 874, 878, 881, 882, 884, 888, 893, 898, 904, 907, 914, 922, 924, 929, 934, 938, 941, 947, 948, 949, 950)","(180, 181, 182, 183, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 194, 196, 204, 205, 211, 212, 213, 214, 218, 220, 229, 234, 236, 239, 245, 246, 253, 256, 262, 263, 270, 277, 278, 282, 290, 293, 301, 305, 310, 318, 323, 325, 327, 330, 334, 344, 345, 349, 354, 356, 359, 363, 367, 371, 372, 374, 375, 376, 382, 386, 391, 392, 396, 401, 408, 409, 410, 411, 417, 423, 426, 434, 437, 440, 446, 449, 457, 464, 466, 469, 470, 474, 479, 480, 481, 482, 483, 490, 499, 500, 503, 507, 516, 520, 526, 529, 535, 541, 543, 545, 549, 553, 554, 555, 556, 557, 565, 573, 578, 584, 593, 598, 603, 608, 613, 625, 630, 636, 638, 645, 646, 647, 649, 650, 651, 655, 659, 664, 668, 673, 677, 678, 679, 684, 695, 697, 702, 706, 707, 708, 713, 718, 721, 725, 727, 732, 735, 739, 747, 749, 763, 767, 773, 785, 786, 787, 788, 789, 793, 804, 809, 811, 817, 820, 825, 826, 829, 839, 849, 850, 853, 860, 864, 867, 872, 873, 877, 881, 882, 883, 887, 892, 897, 903, 906, 913, 921, 923, 928, 933, 937, 940, 947, 948, 949, 950, 951)",O,LIPITOR.214

luckily most of the tests came back normal but there was a small spike in something with my liver which was normal before.

called pfizer and talked with nurse there and she recommended i let my doctor know about symptoms.

i quit taking the statin drug 2 years ago.
i went to american heart lung ass. website and put in my 10 year risk factor.
by dropping my total cholesterol from 259 down to 200 only reduced my risk factor by 1%.
i showed this and other info to my doctor and she understood and said it was my choice.
i feel normal today and will never take these drugs again.
here is site to check your risk factor. http://www.fda.gov/opacom/backgrounders/problem.html
also i found out you should report side effects to fda at. http://www.fda.gov/opacom/backgrounders/problem.html
they estimate only 20% to 30% of drug side effects get reported.
i encourage everyone to report their experiences with these drugs.
(we have to the doctors don't).
these statins are dangerous over perscribed drugs.","['.', '\n', 'i', 'quit', 'taking', 'the', 'statin', 'drug', '2', 'years', 'ago', '.', '\n', 'i', 'went', 'to', 'american', 'heart', 'lung', 'ass', '.', 'website', 'and', 'put', 'in', 'my', '10', 'year', 'risk', 'factor', '.', '\n', 'by', 'dropping', 'my', 'total', 'cholesterol', 'from', '259', 'down', 'to', '200', 'only', 'reduced', 'my', 'risk', 'factor', 'by', '1', '%', '.', '\n', 'i', 'showed', 'this', 'and', 'other', 'info', 'to', 'my', 'doctor', 'and', 'she', 'understood', 'and', 'said', 'it', 'was', 'my', 'choice', '.', '\n', 'i', 'feel', 'normal', 'today', 'and', 'will', 'never', 'take', 'these', 'drugs', 'again', '.', '\n', 'here', 'is', 'site', 'to', 'check', 'your', 'risk', 'factor', '.', 'http', ':', '/', '/', 'www', '.', 'fda', '.', 'gov', '/', 'opacom', '/', 'backgrounders', '/', 'problem', '.', 'html', '\n', 'also', 'i', 'found', 'out', 'you', 'should', 'report', 'side', 'effects', 'to', 'fda', 'at', '.', 'http', ':', '/', '/', 'www', '.', 'fda', '.', 'gov', '/', 'opacom', '/', 'backgrounders', '/', 'problem', '.', 'html', '\n', 'they', 'estimate', 'only', '20', '%', 'to', '30', '%', 'of', 'drug', 'side', 'effects', 'get', 'reported', '.', '\n', 'i', 'encourage', 'everyone', 'to', 'report', 'their', 'experiences', 'with', 'these', 'drugs', '.', '\n', '(', 'we', 'have', 'to', 'the', 'doctors', 'don', ""'"", 't', ')', '.', '\n', 'these', 'statins', 'are', 'dangerous', 'over', 'perscribed', 'drugs', '.', '\n']","(102, 103, 104, 106, 111, 118, 122, 129, 134, 136, 142, 145, 146, 147, 149, 154, 157, 166, 172, 177, 180, 182, 190, 194, 198, 201, 204, 207, 212, 217, 223, 224, 225, 228, 237, 240, 246, 258, 263, 267, 272, 275, 279, 284, 292, 295, 300, 307, 310, 311, 312, 313, 314, 316, 323, 328, 332, 338, 343, 346, 349, 356, 360, 364, 375, 379, 384, 387, 391, 394, 400, 401, 402, 404, 409, 416, 422, 426, 431, 437, 442, 448, 454, 459, 460, 461, 466, 469, 474, 477, 483, 488, 493, 499, 501, 505, 506, 507, 508, 511, 512, 515, 516, 519, 520, 526, 527, 540, 541, 548, 549, 553, 554, 559, 561, 567, 571, 575, 582, 589, 594, 602, 605, 609, 611, 613, 617, 618, 619, 620, 623, 624, 627, 628, 631, 632, 638, 639, 652, 653, 660, 661, 665, 666, 671, 680, 685, 687, 689, 692, 694, 696, 699, 704, 709, 717, 721, 729, 730, 731, 733, 743, 752, 755, 762, 768, 780, 785, 791, 796, 797, 798, 799, 802, 807, 810, 814, 822, 825, 826, 827, 828, 829, 830, 836, 844, 848, 858, 863, 874, 879, 880)","(103, 104, 105, 110, 117, 121, 128, 133, 135, 141, 145, 146, 147, 148, 153, 156, 165, 171, 176, 180, 181, 189, 193, 197, 200, 203, 206, 211, 216, 223, 224, 225, 227, 236, 239, 245, 257, 262, 266, 271, 274, 278, 283, 291, 294, 299, 306, 309, 311, 312, 313, 314, 315, 322, 327, 331, 337, 342, 345, 348, 355, 359, 363, 374, 378, 383, 386, 390, 393, 400, 401, 402, 403, 408, 415, 421, 425, 430, 436, 441, 447, 453, 459, 460, 461, 465, 468, 473, 476, 482, 487, 492, 499, 500, 505, 506, 507, 508, 511, 512, 515, 516, 519, 520, 526, 527, 540, 541, 548, 549, 553, 554, 558, 560, 566, 570, 574, 581, 588, 593, 601, 604, 608, 611, 612, 617, 618, 619, 620, 623, 624, 627, 628, 631, 632, 638, 639, 652, 653, 660, 661, 665, 666, 670, 679, 684, 687, 688, 691, 694, 695, 698, 703, 708, 716, 720, 729, 730, 731, 732, 742, 751, 754, 761, 767, 779, 784, 790, 796, 797, 798, 799, 801, 806, 809, 813, 821, 825, 826, 827, 828, 829, 830, 835, 843, 847, 857, 862, 873, 879, 880, 881)",O,LIPITOR.901

much to my surprise there is a significant amount of study and history of this connection.
(google statins tendon )

she said she realized that my cholesteral would go back up, but cpk is of concern.
was raised to mid 200's.
after a month i went in and of course my cholesteral was back up and my cpk level was elevated to over 500.
now am having another blood test a week later.
not sure what it will show but i feel horrible.","[',', 'etc', 'but', 'kept', 'taking', '.', '\n', 'i', 'had', 'tests', 'done', 'after', 'a', 'month', '.', '\n', 'my', 'doctor', 'sent', 'a', 'letter', 'and', 'said', 'to', 'cut', 'the', 'dose', 'in', 'half', 'for', 'a', 'month', 'and', 'have', 'tests', 'again', '.', '\n', 'after', 'my', 'second', 'set', 'of', 'tests', 'she', 'called', 'me', 'and', 'told', 'me', 'to', 'go', 'off', 'completely', '.', '\n', 'she', 'said', 'she', 'realized', 'that', 'my', 'cholesteral', 'would', 'go', 'back', 'up', ',', 'but', 'cpk', 'is', 'of', 'concern', '.', '\n', 'was', 'raised', 'to', 'mid', '200', ""'"", 's', '.', '\n', 'after', 'a', 'month', 'i', 'went', 'in', 'and', 'of', 'course', 'my', 'cholesteral', 'was', 'back', 'up', 'and', 'my', 'cpk', 'level', 'was', 'elevated', 'to', 'over', '500', '.', '\n', 'now', 'am', 'having', 'another', 'blood', 'test', 'a', 'week', 'later', '.', '\n', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'it', 'will', 'show', 'but', 'i', 'feel', 'horrible', '.', '\n']","(115, 117, 121, 125, 130, 136, 137, 138, 140, 144, 150, 155, 161, 163, 168, 169, 170, 173, 180, 185, 187, 194, 198, 203, 206, 210, 214, 219, 222, 227, 231, 233, 239, 243, 248, 254, 259, 260, 261, 267, 270, 277, 281, 284, 290, 294, 301, 304, 308, 313, 316, 319, 322, 326, 336, 337, 338, 342, 347, 351, 360, 365, 368, 380, 386, 389, 394, 396, 398, 402, 406, 409, 412, 419, 420, 421, 425, 432, 435, 439, 442, 443, 444, 445, 446, 452, 454, 460, 462, 467, 470, 474, 477, 484, 487, 499, 503, 508, 511, 515, 518, 522, 528, 532, 541, 544, 549, 552, 553, 554, 558, 561, 568, 576, 582, 587, 589, 594, 599, 600, 601, 605, 610, 615, 618, 623, 628, 632, 634, 639, 647, 648)","(116, 120, 124, 129, 136, 137, 138, 139, 143, 149, 154, 160, 162, 168, 169, 170, 172, 179, 184, 186, 193, 197, 202, 205, 209, 213, 218, 221, 226, 230, 232, 238, 242, 247, 253, 259, 260, 261, 266, 269, 276, 280, 283, 289, 293, 300, 303, 307, 312, 315, 318, 321, 325, 336, 337, 338, 341, 346, 350, 359, 364, 367, 379, 385, 388, 393, 396, 397, 401, 405, 408, 411, 419, 420, 421, 424, 431, 434, 438, 442, 443, 444, 445, 446, 451, 453, 459, 461, 466, 469, 473, 476, 483, 486, 498, 502, 507, 510, 514, 517, 521, 527, 531, 540, 543, 548, 552, 553, 554, 557, 560, 567, 575, 581, 586, 588, 593, 599, 600, 601, 604, 609, 614, 617, 622, 627, 631, 633, 638, 647, 648, 649)",O,LIPITOR.978
