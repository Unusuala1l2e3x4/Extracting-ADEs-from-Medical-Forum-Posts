## Resume Entry
Extracting Adverse Drug Events (ADEs) from Medical Forum Posts\
February 2023 – April 2023\
SI 630 – NLP: Algorithms and People
-	Applied NER modeling using Flair and PyTorch libraries to identify ADEs and associated drugs, symptoms, and diseases in an annotated corpus of 1,250 forum posts.
-	Conducted fine-tuning of pre-trained transformer models from Hugging Face, such as XLM-RoBERTa, SpanBERT, and Bio_ClinicalBERT, to enhance model accuracy.
-	Achieved F1 scores of 0.73 and 0.77 for BIOES and BIO tagging schemes, respectively, performing similarly to models in related studies.
